                        <h2>Jouney to Quy Nhon</h2>
                        <div>
                            The picture was filmed in Quy Nhon City
                            beach and Hoai Nhon's moutain. Quy Nhon is a small city in the Central Coast Vietnam. 
                            It belongs to Binh Dinh province that is known as martial arts land of Vietnam. 
                            This is not a tourism destination so it's peaceful, quiet, friendly people, cheap price. 
                            Like another Coast cities, it has very fresh sea food. 
                            Now, some places are developing to attract tourists but if you want to find somewhere not crowded, 
                            this is.You can go to the top of Vung Chua mountain by motorbike (from Ghenh Rang, near the Queen beach). 
                            It takes about 15 minutes. This is the best place to see all of the beautiful city, graceful sea with natural beauty of Thi Nai lagoon,

                            This's a love story while i'm here,I think it very romance. In the afternoon of 2019, I went to visit a village near the beach,
                            the environment here is very clean, everyone is very friendly. While buying seafood, I met her, she has a short hair and blond, her skin so white
                            I think she tall about 1m5, and look her so cuteeee&#9786;.And after that, I always find a way to talk to her. And now She is my girlfriend. I think Quy Nhon is not only beautiful 
                            but the people here are also likable. IN THAT AFTERNOON NO WINE, SUNSET MADE ME DRUNK&#9728;&#9829;
